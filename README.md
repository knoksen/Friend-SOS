**Friend SOS** is a modern, installable Progressive Web App (PWA) designed to provide a fast and simple way to send a detailed emergency alert to a predefined list of contacts. It leverages the Google Gemini API to intelligently craft a clear, concise SOS message, and uses your device's native capabilities to dispatch it instantly.
